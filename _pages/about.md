Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a M.S. student in Management Science at the Hefei University of Technology, advised by [Shuangyao Zhao](http://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/zhaoshuangyao/zh_CN/index.htm). I conduct my research as part of the teams led by Prof. [Shanlin Yang](http://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/ysl/zh_CN/index.htm), Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and Prof. [Qiang Zhang](http://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/zhangqiang1/zh_CN/index.htm), Dean of the School of Management.

My research interests lie in computer vision and multi-agent systems, with a particular emphasis on data-centric and human-centric AI. In the long term, I aim to to build a data-driven AI system that: <br> 1. captures and represents user aesthetic preferences from multi-modal inputs (e.g., vision, language, spatial information), 2. generates personalized and controllable design, 3. allowing designs to be reconstructed, understood, and refined based on human feedback.
